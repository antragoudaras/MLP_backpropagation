# MLP Backpropagation

This repository contains Python scripts that implement the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm from scratch using the NumPy library and also using the PyTorch framework.

## Description

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network model that consists of multiple layers of nodes, each connected to the next layer. It is a popular algorithm used for various machine learning tasks, including classification and regression. The MLP is trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which is an efficient method for updating the weights of the network based on the error between the predicted output and the true output.

This repository provides two implementations of the MLP algorithm: one implemented using the NumPy library and another implemented using the PyTorch framework. Both implementations utilize the backpropagation algorithm for training the MLP.

1. **NumPy Implementation**: The `mlp_numpy.py` script contains the implementation of the MLP algorithm using the NumPy library. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, and it provides efficient array operations that are essential for implementing neural networks.

2. **PyTorch Implementation**: The `mlp_torch.py` script contains the implementation of the MLP algorithm using the PyTorch library. PyTorch is a deep learning framework that provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks. It offers automatic differentiation, making it a popular choice for deep learning research and applications.
